# What is FLL?

* FIRST Lego League, FLL, is the K-8 branch of FIRST Robotics, a global organization where teams of youth work to design, build, and program robots and present compete for awards. 
* FLL has three sub-sections/levels - Discover (ages 4-6), Explore (ages 6-10), and Challenge (ages 9-16, but varies by country). 
* FLL provides opportunities for students to kickstart their journeys in STEM and robotics, developing technical skills while working with not only their own team, but also with others in the community.
* You may have heard of the FIRST pipeline - FLL → FTC → FRC, or some version of that. FLL undoubtedly provides you with the skillset and experience for FTC and FRC
