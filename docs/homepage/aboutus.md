# About...

## The Team
We are FIRST Tech Challenge team 25, Rock n’ Roll Robots. FIRST Tech Challenge is the grades 7-12 branch of FIRST. We are an all-girls community-based team from Pasadena, CA, and 8 of our 12 current members have been in FLL. Because FLL started each of our pathways in robotics, we strive to give back to the community by providing a platform for FLL teams to learn and share. 

## The Cause
The goal of this guide is to give you a comprehensive outline of all aspects of FLL, including robot design, robot game, programming, innovation project, core values, team management, and much more. This is not only a place for you to learn what FLL is all about, but also to reference throughout your season. Rookie and veteran teams alike may all feel lost at some point (trust us, we know!), so we hope that you can find the answers you’re looking for here - and if not, utilize the incredible community that is FIRST - head to our discord (coming soon), forums, or email us at rnrr@rocknrollrobots25.com!
